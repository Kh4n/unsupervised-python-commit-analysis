# unsupervised-python-commit-analysis
Made this in 2 days. Was an attempt to analyze django and train an autoencoder on some commits.
Had some slightly successful results. One of the "bad commits" had a training error that was higher than most of the others, except one.
With more/better features this can probably be improved
